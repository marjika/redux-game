<h2>Redux Practice</h2>

This application was created for practice in using React Redux.  It is based on a tutorial from React U.  I have deviated slightly from the tutorial in that I used a different sprite sheet with a female character and more iterations for the walk.  I also had to change the placement of the tile background images folder as the build would not display them when the images folder was in the public folder.
